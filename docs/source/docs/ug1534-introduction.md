# Introduction

This User Manual describes installation, configuration and operation of Alveo U25N SmartNIC features, performance, diagnostic tools and configuration.

Xilinx Alveo U25N card is developed for cloud and virtualization architects building modern data centers. The Alveo U25N card which is a Smart NIC, is a programmable and a modern Ethernet network card that combines network and security acceleration functions- the two much-needed features for the modern datacenters, into a single platform.

Xilinx Alveo U25N Smart NIC is based on the fusion of three technologies: XtremeScale™ X2 Ethernet Controller, a Xilinx Zynq® UltraScale+™ FPGA, and a multi-core Arm processor combined in a powerful XCU25 MPSoC. Xilinx Alveo U25N comes in Half Height Half Length (HHHL) form factor and leverages PCIe Gen3*8(*16 connector) host interface.

The FPGA enables in-line hardware acceleration by offloading the host CPU's network processing. Arm processor handles traffic processing and FPGA-related management and statistics. The X2 Ethernet Controller chip provides a platform for processing 2*SFP28 ports of 25 Gigabit Ethernet via field-proven software drivers.
